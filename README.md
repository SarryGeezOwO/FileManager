# File Sorter Program >-<
### ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹Hello im Cjay, I am a begginer at programming!!
* the Program is a console application that runs on .Net ( C# )
* Open the .exe if possible, if not you can download the CS file instead and run it through CMD ( if you have .Net ) ðŸ˜¢
* just type in the path or folder path you want to be modified ðŸ’€:
* the porgram will create the neccessary folder to contain the files to their respective extensions ðŸ¤—:
* The Program will only interact with the files inside the given path and will not interact with the folders inside the path ðŸ˜€:
* Feel free to modify the code, especially the folder name Customization ðŸ˜ƒ
* The folder name will be .(extension) if there is no customization whatsoever in that specific extension of file
* I made this as a challenge for myself and it might not be the cleanest code out there but it made me feel proud ðŸ˜³:
